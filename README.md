# stm32BasePrjects 
 In this branch
contains several templet projects for stm32 
* NG_v1 
  * this is a minimal setup for the rosSearial package in order to provide stable conection via UART3
  * stm32f746g was used 
  * pb6,pb7 used as basic diagnose outputs
  * upon a sucsessfull transmiton pb7 shoud toggle in 1Hz

#File Structure
 *NG_v1 -> stm32f7source code 
 *src-> catkin file system runs on sbc
